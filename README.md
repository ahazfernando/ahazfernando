Fueled by curiosity and a passion for building meaningful digital experiences, I’m a Computer Science undergraduate driven by the intersection of data, design, and technology.

With hands on experience designing and developing full-stack web applications, I’ve led UI/UX and front end projects from concept to deployment crafting products that are both visually refined and functionally powerful. My toolkit spans React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Figma, and the MERN stack, and I’m equally at home in analytical spaces exploring data visualization, performance insights, and product optimization.
